## Your Name

After years of working in PM/Marketing/Saas roles in London, I wanted to start to specialize in doing something more creative. One Direction turned me down, so I decided to join Makers...  

I've been studying at Makers Academy since August 2019, really cementing best practices and understanding of software development.  
My goal is to work at a company where I can continue to both improve and diversify the skillset that I'm really enjoying developing at Makers, as well as hopefully use some of the experience I've gained working on technical projects in previous roles.

## Skills

#### Initiative

I love problem solving efficiently. At Brainlabs we were spending too much time on manual creation of ad campaigns, decreasing profitability. I suggested automating the process for Deliveroo, which we later [won an award for](https://www.brainlabsdigital.com/brainlabs-best-large-ppc-agency/)!

#### Collaborative

I've always preferred shared success over individual recognition; the reward of achieving something collectively, for me, is what I always hope to build in any professional role.  
At Flixmedia, for instance, I developed new processes to help the client and tech teams communicate more effectively, and share responsibility for feature launches and go-live.
