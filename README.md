## Dan Gyi

After years of working in PM/Marketing/Saas roles in London, I wanted to start to specialize in doing something more creative. 
I joined Makers because I wanted to work in a more collaborative role that enabled that creativity/problem solving. It turned out to be one of the best decisions I had ever made!

I studied at Makers Academy from August to November 2019, understanding the core principles of the most popular programming languages, and really cementing best processes and practices as a software engineer.
My goal is to work at a company where I can continue to both improve and diversify the skillset that I really enjoyed developing at Makers, as well as hopefully use some of the experience I've gained working on technical projects in previous roles.

## Latest Projects
- **[Chessy](https://github.com/DanGyi23/makers-final-project)**
  * 2-week final project at Makers. We self-taught a new language (Python) and built a 1/2 player Slack Chess Bot with the option to have random rules injected into the game state. All game logic was coded from scratch, and I decided to build a minimax algorithm for improved AI evaluation, using some heuristics to improve the decision-making in the opening. 
- **[Tech Tests](https://github.com/DanGyi23/tech-tests-wk10-makers)**
  * A selection of tech-tests that demonstrate strong TDD process and understanding of core principles of Ruby/JS
- **[Makers BnB](https://github.com/DanGyi23/wk6-MakersBnB)**
  * Using a combination of front-end JS/JQuery, and back end Ruby, we created our very own version of AirBnB. Full description in Readme.
- **[AceBook](https://github.com/DanGyi23/acebook)**
  * A live web app using a variety of different technologies, primarily Rails. Full description in Readme link above.
- **[News App](https://github.com/DanGyi23/news-summary-challenge)**
  * I challenged myself to build a news-summary web app, using Guardian and Alien APIs. I chose to build it twice, once using vanilla front-end JS, and once using JQuery, to compare the processes.

## Skills

#### Initiative

I love problem solving efficiently. At Brainlabs we were spending too much time on manual creation of ad campaigns, decreasing profitability. I suggested automating the process for Deliveroo, which we later [won an award for](https://www.brainlabsdigital.com/brainlabs-best-large-ppc-agency/)!

#### Collaboration

I've always preferred shared success over individual recognition; the reward of achieving something collectively, for me, is what I always hope to build in any professional role.  
At Flixmedia, for instance, I developed new processes to help the client and tech teams communicate more effectively, and share responsibility for feature launches and go-live.
