## Dan Gyi

I studied at Makers Academy from August to November 2019, understanding the core principles of the most popular programming languages, and really cementing best processes and practices.
My goal is to work at a company where I can continue to both improve and diversify the skillset that I really enjoyed developing at Makers, as well as use some of the commercial experience I've gained working on technical projects in previous roles.

## Latest Projects
- **[Chessy](https://github.com/DanGyi23/makers-final-project)**
  * 2-week final project at Makers. We self-taught a new language (Python) and built a 1/2 player Slack Chess Bot with the option to have random rules injected into the game state. All game logic was coded from scratch, and I decided to build a minimax algorithm for improved AI evaluation, using some heuristics to improve the decision-making in the opening. 
- **[Tech Tests](https://github.com/DanGyi23/tech-tests-wk10-makers)**
  * A selection of tech-tests that demonstrate strong TDD process and understanding of core principles of Ruby/JS
- **[Makers BnB](https://github.com/DanGyi23/wk6-MakersBnB)**
  * Using a combination of front-end JS/JQuery, and back end Ruby, we created our very own version of AirBnB. Full description in Readme.
- **[AceBook](https://github.com/DanGyi23/acebook)**
  * A live web app using a variety of different technologies, primarily Rails. Full description in Readme link above.
- **[News App](https://github.com/DanGyi23/news-summary-challenge)**
  * I challenged myself to build a news-summary web app, using Guardian and Alien APIs. I chose to build it twice, once using vanilla front-end JS, and once using JQuery, to compare the processes.

## Relevant Experience

## Skills

#### Initiative

- I love problem solving efficiently. At Brainlabs we were spending too much time on manual creation of ad campaigns, decreasing profitability. I suggested automating the process for Deliveroo, which we later [won an award for](https://www.brainlabsdigital.com/brainlabs-best-large-ppc-agency/)!
- I regularly attend meet-ups and lectures in London to immerse myself in the technologies that I'm interested in. I've attended workshops for basic AI algorithms, process improvement, JS and React fundamentals, big data structures, and many more.
- I'm currently teaching myself German, partly because I like the language and the country, but mainly because I believe that associative learning is valuable for retention of information. Much like playing a musical instrument whilst studying, learning a language has nicely complemented my journey so far in software engineering.

#### Collaboration

- I've always preferred shared success over individual recognition; the reward of achieving something collectively, for me, is what I always hope to build in any professional role.  
- At Flixmedia, for instance, I developed new processes to help the client and tech teams communicate more effectively, and share responsibility for feature launches and go-live.
- I developed 2 innovation teams whilst at Brainlabs to work on different technical products for 2 growing clients of ours. We successfully shipped award winning projects that secured us client funding for 2+ years.

## Education

#### University of Manchester (Sep 2011 to Jun 2014)

- Chemistry with Medicinal Chemistry

- Worked at the students union, in events planning, mentoring and student support
